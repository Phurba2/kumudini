        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <img src="kumudini_team.jpg" alt="Kumudini Team" style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p>In Nepal, forty-two percent of the population is under the eighteen years of age and out of which almost half comprise of girls and a majority of them live in rural areas. The Constitution of Nepal (2015) and the international legal instruments which Nepal has ratified such as CRC (Convention on the Rights of the Child) and CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women) provide equal rights to all girls, irrespective of caste, religion and gender. But, reality is different. Discrimination between boys and girls start even before birth—some of the girls are not even welcomed into this world. The ones who make it have high chances of being discriminated and deprived of their fundamental rights. Growing up in a patriarchal society often times nip them while they are still buds curtailing their opportunities to blossom to their full potential. In absence of protection mechanism, girls are abused, harassed, exploited and neglected compelling them to live a life of fear.</p>
        <p>“Kumudini” meaning “white night lotus” blossoms during darkness personifying beauty and dignity. We believe that every girl child, particularly the ones subjected to abuse and exploitation, can excel and live a life without fear with strength and dignity by being empowered.</p>
